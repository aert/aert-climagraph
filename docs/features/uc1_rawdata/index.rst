uc1: Manage raw data
====================

.. image:: /images/generated/uc1_data_raw.png

Raw data points are called ``Primary DataPoints`` (**PDP**).

``Consolidated DataPoints`` (**CDP**) are purely computed values resulting from
the aggregation of ``PDPs``.

Converting ``PDPs`` to ``CDPs`` is a core feature of the system.
These ``CDPs`` are used in the plotting system.
